Everybody is welcome. Feel free to bring your questions on the subject with you and to propose topics for future meetings as well. The discussion will be ideally driven by questions and by participants.

Almost each page contains examples and explanation. Sometimes this is very technical, but with some experience and complementing it with other resources (e.g. Stack Overflow) it is a great source to use.</p> <p>Do you want to play around with different compilers (or different compiler versions) or, maybe, inspect the assembler code? This is possible in your browser with a couple of clicks!  And you can even get a link to share your experiment with whoever you want.

It contains guidance about how to write good code and advice about what should be avoided. Get there from time to time and read around. </p> <p>This is the main conference about C++. It contains sessions about everything.
