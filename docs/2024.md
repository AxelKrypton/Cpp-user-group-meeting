    ??? abstract "Classes and the rule of zero"

        After having discussed uniform initialization (a.k.a. brace initialization), we will try to answer together to the following questions.
        What are special member functions?
        When should I provide a class with them?
        What happens if I provide only some of them?
        What happens if one constructor accept an `std::initializer_list<T>` as parameter?

    ??? abstract "Rvalue and forwarding references"

        This time we will start implementing the special member functions of a `ResourceOwner` class.
        On the way the copy-and-swap idiom will be discussed and we will try to explore what `std::move` and `std::forward` exactly do.
