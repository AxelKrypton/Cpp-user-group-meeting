    ??? abstract "Forwarding references"

        This will complete the planned discussion for last meeting.
        In particular we will try to define what a forwarding (AKA *universal*) reference is and what `std::forward` exactly does.
        Then we will finally implement the special member functions of a `ResourceOwner` class, discussing on the way the copy-and-swap idiom and applying what previously introduced.

    ??? abstract "C++17 flashy introduction"

        Although not that recent anymore, the `C++17` standard introduced many useful and interesting features.
        In this meeting, Alessandro will give a flashy introduction to some of them.
        This talk might be used to select topics for future meetings, too.
        Although discussion is always possible and welcome, this time material will be presented and discussed using slides.

    ??? abstract "`std::variant` and `std::visit`"

        This time we will have an external guest, [Johannes Misch](https://github.com/IyeOnline), giving a presentation followed by open discussion.

        Following the practical example of a JSON type, we will discriminate C++'s type-safe union against polymorphism and visit the most important features of `std::variant` and `std::visit`, including brief looks at features added in newer C++ standards that improve the usability of variant.

    ??? abstract "The visitor design pattern"

        As a follow-up of the previous meeting, we will explore the visitor design pattern, focussing on an example of a standard implementation.
        After having understood how it works, we will take advantage of `std::variant` to refactor the code in a more modern way.

    ??? abstract "Polymorphism"

        While discussing the visitor design pattern we decided to use this meeting to revise and further explore the realm of polymorphism.
        After having recalled the basic rules of the game, some more real-life oriented question will be addressed.
        What is a `dynamic_cast` and when is it acceptable to be used?
        Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in book "The Pragmatic Programmer" wrote: *«Inheritance is Rarely the Answer.»* - why?
        Arguments in favour and against inheritance will be discussed.

    ???+ abstract "Core guidelines: Open discussion"

        This time we will have a look into the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) project, which was started by Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter about 10 years ago.
        The spirit of the meeting can be summarized with Bjarne's official quote about the project:
        > "Within C++ is a smaller, simpler, safer language struggling to get out."
